Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-blanket-qunit --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-blanket-qunit');\n```\n\n## Blanket.js dependency\n\nThis plugin requires Blanket.js v1.1.5 which is currently still in development.  Check the blanket.js version in the [dev branch](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/development/dist/qunit/blanket.js) in the meantime.  \n\n## The \"blanket_qunit\" task\n\n### See Also\n\nThis plugin is based off of grunt-contrib-qunit.  For general config options and examples, please see that repo.\n\n### Overview\nIn your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `blanket_qunit` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  blanket_qunit: {\n    options: {\n\t\turls: ['test.html?coverage=true&gruntReport'],\n        threshold: 70\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe `urls` param works the same way as it does in the base `grunt-contrib-qunit` plugin, with two important considerations.  First, you should pass `&coverage=true` as a URL parameter as shown above to trigger blanket.js.  This is the same as clicking the `Enable Coverage` checkbox in the QUnit report.  Second, you may pass another parameter such as `&gruntReport` to trigger the custom blanket reporter that talks to the grunt task.  See the next section for more info.\n\n### Custom Reporter\n\nIn order for Blanket.js to communicate with the Grunt task, you must enable a custom blanket reporter.  See the `grunt-reporter.js` file in the `reporter` directory in this repo.\n\nYou can enable this reporter in one of two ways:\n\n1. As an inline proprety in your blanket.js script declaration, like so:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"blanket.js\"\n        data-cover-reporter=\"reporter/grunt-reporter.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThis method is suitable if your test runner html file is only used for headless testing.  Do not use this if you will be using this test runner html file in a browser, as it will spew a bunch of alerts at you (see the reporter implementation for the ugly `alert` hack used to communicate with phantomjs).\n\n2. As a conditional option evaulauted at runtime in your test runner html, like so:\n\n```js\n<script>\n    if (location.href.match(/(\\?|&)gruntReport($|&|=)/)) {\n        blanket.options(\"reporter\", \"reporter/grunt-reporter.js\");\n    }\n</script>\n``` \n\nPlace this script snippet after your blanket.js script declaration.  This allows you to conditionally only enable this custom reporter if the `gruntReport` URL parameter is specified.  This way, you can share the same test runner html file between two use cases: running it in the browser and viewing the report inline, and running it via grunt. \n\n\n### Options\n\n#### options.threshold\nType: `Number`\nDefault value: `60`\n\nThe minimum percent coverage per-file.  Any files that have coverage below this threshold will fail the build.  By default, only the failing files will be output in the console.  To show passing files as well, use the grunt `--verbose` option.\n\n#### options.moduleThreshold\nType: `Number`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nThe minimum percent coverage per-module.  Any modules that have coverage below this threshold will fail the build.  Both passing and failing module statistics will be shown in the output.\n\nThis option requires that the `modulePattern` property is also set (see below).\n\n#### options.modulePattern\nType: `RegEx`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nA regular expression defining how to extract a module name from the path of a covered file.  The regular expression should include\na single parenthetical expression which will be matched as the module name.  For example, to define the module name as the text\nin between the first two slashes, you could use:\n\n```\nmodulePattern: \"./(.*?)/\"\n```\n\n#### options.globalThreshold\nType: `Number`\nDefault value: undefined\n\nThe minimum percent coverage overall, averaged for all files.  An average coverage percentage below this \nvalue will fail the build.Both passing and failing module statistics will be shown in the output.\n\n\n### Command Line Options\n\n#### threshold\n\nOverride the threshold specified in the Gruntfile.  \n\nFor example, if you wanted to test your files using a 90% threshold, and the Gruntfile had a different threshold specified, you could override it like so:\n\n`grunt --threshold=90`\n\n#### moduleThreshold\n\nOverride the moduleThreshold specified in the Gruntfile.  \n\nFor example, if you wanted to test your files using a 90% module threshold, and the Gruntfile had a different module threshold specified, you could override it like so:\n\n`grunt --moduleThreshold=90`\n\n#### globalThreshold\n\nOverride the globalThreshold specified in the Gruntfile.  \n\nFor example, if you wanted to test your files using a 90% global threshold, and the Gruntfile had a different global threshold specified, you could override it like so:\n\n`grunt --globalThreshold=90`\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n\n### 0.2.0\n*Released 19 June 2013*\n\n* Added per-module and global coverage reporting\n\n### 0.1.7\n*Released 14 June 2013*\n\n* Fixed Issue #2: Failure if coverage is exactly equal to threshold\n\n### 0.1.6\n*Released 13 June 2013*\n\n* Fixed [Issue #1](https://github.com/ModelN/grunt-blanket-qunit/issues/1): Sort file paths alphabetically.\n* Added extra spacing in coverage percentage output to keep filenames aligned for easier readability. \n\n### 0.1.5\n*Released 13 June 2013*\n\n* Added command line override for coverage threshold\n\n### 0.1.4\n*Released 23 May 2013*\n\n* Doc updates & misc fixes\n\n### 0.1.0\n*Released 23 May 2013*\n\n* Initial release\n",
